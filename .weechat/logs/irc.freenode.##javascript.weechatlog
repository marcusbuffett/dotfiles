2015-08-21 10:27:23	ljharb	limiting the splitting is just split + slice
2015-08-21 10:27:30	wdbl	if the option is called `limit` in other languages, that's a bad name IMO. Limiting the number of results actually makes sense. The option you want is removing empty entries.
2015-08-21 10:27:37	ljharb	it doesn't split everything, it just stops iterating the string to produce splits

2015-08-21 23:06:12	Gilgameshkun	One use is converting the data structure into a reference list so it can be serialized even with cyclic references.
2015-08-21 23:06:15	Gilgameshkun	And then converted back.
2015-08-21 23:06:26	Gilgameshkun	Has to be cloned during each conversion iteration so as not to affect the original data structure.

2015-08-22 09:21:49	zerobaud	yansanmo: are you sure its possible to add a HTML element form a external javascript? I really cant get it to work... even changing the body with document.body.innerHTML += '<h1>test</h1>' doesnt show anything
2015-08-22 09:22:01	Sorella	socialblogsite: knowing "which line conditionals are triggered" tells you: nothing. Literally nothing. It's not helpful at all.

2015-08-22 09:22:56	Sorella	All browsers have one these days
2015-08-22 09:23:06	zerobaud	yansanmo: it does work with document.writeln strange...
2015-08-22 09:23:16	socialblogsite	yeah, the problem is there are lots of loops and nested ifs… I’d be clicking “next” forever before I see it.

2015-08-22 09:24:05	Sorella	socialblogsite: how is that a problem? You want to use "step into" and "step over" rather than "continue". The first takes you inside the function you're calling, the second takes you to the next statement (without entering the function)

2015-08-22 09:24:44	Sorella	Of course, if your source code is badly written, it'll be much harder to debug. But stepping debuggers will still make it less hard than anything else.

2015-08-22 09:27:48	zomg	I never had an issue with it though since the files that need to be edited by hand tend to be reasonably small
2015-08-22 09:27:55	mchelen	generally json files should not be hand edited
2015-08-22 09:28:00	GreenJello	I've tried a lot of json editors, they tend to be more difficult than helpful
2015-08-22 09:28:00	kristian_on_linu	mchelen: yeah
2015-08-22 09:28:16	mchelen	kristian_on_linu: what problem do you encounter when using vim?
2015-08-22 09:28:18	kristian_on_linu	and I'm not looking to edit, just figure out what
2015-08-22 09:28:26	kristian_on_linu	responds to what, sorry
2015-08-22 09:28:26	GreenJello	I guess you could do json -> yaml -> editor -> json
2015-08-22 09:28:54	mchelen	you might use some editor that has code folding
