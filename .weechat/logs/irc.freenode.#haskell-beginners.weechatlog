2015-08-20 21:09:04	joliv	Pushed a fn that used (:[]) to list-ify a number through pointfree.io, and it turned it into `return` :o it all makes sense now
2015-08-20 21:09:04	joliv	But I was wondering—is `pure` or `return` preferrable there to lift?
2015-08-20 21:09:04	joliv	Both work fine.

2015-08-23 17:55:38	Lokathor	gfixler, i've installed ghc in the past, but might not in the future. if stack can manage when to get ghc for me just fine, why bother?
2015-08-23 17:56:03	gfixler	Lokathor: well, I often just make a 20-line haskell thing to try out something
2015-08-23 17:56:19	gfixler	Lokathor: if it requires setting up a project and pulling in ghc for every one of those, it might be a pain
2015-08-23 17:56:46	Lokathor	"stack exec ghci" can work anywhere, not just from within a project. stack pulls in a GHC when you set it up
2015-08-23 17:57:13	Lokathor	it doesn't get ghc per project though
2015-08-23 17:59:00	Lokathor	it seems to get ghc per lts version that it needs to build for
2015-08-23 17:59:23	gfixler	I need to find a for-dummies guide that just lists the few steps required
2015-08-23 18:00:35	Lokathor	for stack?
2015-08-23 18:01:40	taksuyu	I've been having troubles with development environments due to just stack to handle everything.
2015-08-23 18:01:54	taksuyu	Not that I would change how I manage stuff, it works quite well.
2015-08-23 18:03:12	Lokathor	taksuyu, do you mean "due to [people] just [using] stack to handle everything?"
2015-08-23 18:03:32	gfixler	Lokathor: yes
2015-08-23 18:03:35	taksuyu	No, I mean like all my tooling just breaking down and not working
2015-08-23 18:03:48	gfixler	Lokathor: so far not a single stack command has ever worked for me on 2 OSes
2015-08-23 18:03:51	taksuyu	The support for stack just isn't anywhere near as worked out
2015-08-23 18:04:28	gfixler	I never build anything. I'm just learning.
2015-08-23 18:04:43	gfixler	I just want to be able to easily include a few libraries from the internet and try out ideas

2015-08-23 18:05:04	gfixler	and have ghc, etc., just match up properly
2015-08-23 18:05:20	taksuyu	I've found that it works like a charm, and I do a lot of weird constraint checking
2015-08-23 18:05:30	taksuyu	Been building project trees lately
2015-08-23 18:05:30	Lokathor	gfixler, if you want to include extra libraries, you need to set up a project for that
2015-08-23 18:05:44	gfixler	Lokathor: via cabal?
2015-08-23 18:05:53	Lokathor	yes, you can setup a cabal file
2015-08-23 18:05:59	Lokathor	and stack will work with that
2015-08-23 18:06:04	taksuyu	Quite nice to put projects within projects and build the whole tree in one go with stack :D
2015-08-23 18:06:04	gfixler	but everyone has said I don't need to install cabal to use stack
2015-08-23 18:06:06	Lokathor	if you just want to use the base libraries that come with ghc, you get stack, put it in your path, then run "stack setup"
2015-08-23 18:06:31	Lokathor	gfixler, stack uses the cabal file format as part of its system, even though it doesn't use the cabal binary
2015-08-23 18:06:53	gfixler	Lokathor: I tried stack setup, and it didn't seem to do anything
2015-08-23 18:07:06	Lokathor	are you sure stack was in your path?
2015-08-23 18:07:20	tempname11	anyone know a good introductory material for stack?
2015-08-23 18:07:25	gfixler	http://lpaste.net/139534
2015-08-23 18:07:34	gfixler	yes, stack by itself spits out all the stack commands
2015-08-23 18:07:43	Lokathor	ah, that's just what you want
2015-08-23 18:07:53	Lokathor	its' setup now.. but for an older lts for some reason
2015-08-23 18:08:03	gfixler	what's setup?
2015-08-23 18:08:09	gfixler	ls -la shows nothing in that folder
2015-08-23 18:08:21	Lokathor	stack set itself up in its own folder elsewhere
2015-08-23 18:08:28	Lokathor	the setup is not local to a folder
2015-08-23 18:08:40	taksuyu	stack has two directories that you should look for
2015-08-23 18:08:46	gfixler	> stack will use a locally installed GHC
2015-08-23 18:08:47	lambdabot	 Not in scope: ‘stack’Not in scope: ‘will’    Not in scope: ‘locally’
2015-08-23 18:08:47	lambdabot	     Perhaps you meant ‘local’ (imported from Control.Monad.Reader)Not in sco...
2015-08-23 18:08:53	gfixler	sorry, lambdabot
2015-08-23 18:09:05	Lokathor	try "stack ghci"
2015-08-23 18:09:07	taksuyu	~/.stack for global things like GHC, global packages, and configs

2015-08-23 18:09:28	gfixler	why not just .stack?
2015-08-23 18:09:44	taksuyu	Because when you build projects they have different build paths

2015-08-23 18:11:05	taksuyu	.stack is for all the things that aren't constantly rebuilt
2015-08-23 18:11:23	taksuyu	That way you group the development stuff with the development stuff
2015-08-23 18:11:25	gfixler	are you referring to the ~/.stack?
2015-08-23 18:11:30	taksuyu	Yes
2015-08-23 18:11:44	gfixler	oh, is .stack-works also in ~?
2015-08-23 18:11:50	taksuyu	no
2015-08-23 18:11:59	gfixler	it's project-local?
2015-08-23 18:12:06	Lokathor	yes
2015-08-23 18:12:07	taksuyu	.stack-work (sorry typed it wrong earlier) is project local yes
2015-08-23 18:12:11	gfixler	that was my question
2015-08-23 18:12:21	gfixler	if ~/.stack, why not also ./.stack?
2015-08-23 18:12:41	taksuyu	I guess because you can also build stuff in your home directory
2015-08-23 18:12:55	taksuyu	I tend to install quite a few utilities through stack
2015-08-23 18:13:01	gfixler	ah, that makes sense, actually :)
2015-08-23 18:13:12	taksuyu	but I don't have a stack.yaml in my home directory :>
2015-08-23 18:13:12	gfixler	like hlint, hoogle, ghc-mod?
2015-08-23 18:13:17	taksuyu	Yep
2015-08-23 18:13:23	gfixler	and those would go in ~/.stack?
2015-08-23 18:13:35	taksuyu	stack automatically copies them over to ~/.local/bin
2015-08-23 18:13:45	taksuyu	and will warn you if that isn't on your path
2015-08-23 18:13:51	gfixler	wow
2015-08-23 18:14:02	gfixler	I think I'd prefer having the stack folder on my path than that
2015-08-23 18:14:16	 *	taksuyu shrugs
2015-08-23 18:14:22	taksuyu	Can probably change it with an alias
2015-08-23 18:14:38	gfixler	do I still need cabal sandboxes?
2015-08-23 18:14:45	taksuyu	I was using ~/.bin so I just moved stuff over
2015-08-23 18:14:47	gfixler	or does stack install just do the right thing™?
2015-08-23 18:14:53	taksuyu	stack does sandboxing automatically
2015-08-23 18:14:58	gfixler	\o/
2015-08-23 18:15:17	Lokathor	yeah it's new to get used to, but magical once you figure it out
2015-08-23 18:15:27	taksuyu	It'll also build any projects recursively (something I abuse a lot)
2015-08-23 18:16:23	taksuyu	gitsubmodules are my friend ~^~
2015-08-23 18:17:16	gfixler	so I decide to screw around on a temp idea...
2015-08-23 18:17:34	gfixler	mkdir idea; cd idea; stack new idea; stack init; stack ghci?
2015-08-23 18:17:52	gfixler	(this is what I meant by someone just writing out the 5 steps required for a simple need)
2015-08-23 18:18:35	taksuyu	Yeah it works
2015-08-23 18:18:42	taksuyu	Though I'm not terribly found of stack new
2015-08-23 18:19:32	gfixler	oh?
2015-08-23 18:19:37	taksuyu	It creates a subproject structure also (if you aren't used to that)
2015-08-23 18:19:40	gfixler	rather use cabal directly?
2015-08-23 18:19:52	Lokathor	gfixler, if you just want ghci right away, "stack ghci" works anywhere, you don't need a project setup
2015-08-23 18:19:54	gfixler	or rather, set up a cabal file?
2015-08-23 18:19:56	taksuyu	Yeah, least it prompts you for various options
2015-08-23 18:20:33	gfixler	Lokathor: not true: http://lpaste.net/139535
2015-08-23 18:20:35	taksuyu	But I think my problem with it in general is just the assumptions it makes
2015-08-23 18:20:46	gfixler	taksuyu: I see
2015-08-23 18:21:18	gfixler	taksuyu: I don't have cabal installed - what now?
2015-08-23 18:21:19	Lokathor	ohhh
2015-08-23 18:21:21	Lokathor	you're getting that thing i got
2015-08-23 18:21:29	Lokathor	"stack exec ghci" fixes it
2015-08-23 18:21:34	taksuyu	in your home directory you can just stack install cabal-install
2015-08-23 18:21:37	gfixler	Lokathor: ah ha
2015-08-23 18:21:43	gfixler	taksuyu: neat
2015-08-23 18:21:49	Lokathor	you should consider updating to the latest stack, they've fixed that problem
2015-08-23 18:22:15	gfixler	Lokathor: cool - so this fetches [if missing] and runs the latest ghci?
2015-08-23 18:22:16	taksuyu	stack upgrade does that I'm pretty sure
2015-08-23 18:22:39	Lokathor	taksuyu, it does not currently, becase the "latest" isn't released yet
2015-08-23 18:22:39	gfixler	taksuyu: I'm trying it now
2015-08-23 18:22:49	gfixler	"Already at latest version, no upgrade required"
2015-08-23 18:22:51	Lokathor	but you can clone it from git and build yourself
2015-08-23 18:22:57	taksuyu	Oh? I upgraded to 1.3.1
2015-08-23 18:23:14	gfixler	I'm on: Version 0.1.3.1, Git revision 908b04205e6f436d4a5f420b1c6c646ed2b804d7
2015-08-23 18:23:37	gfixler	Lokathor: so I guess the latest available from stack upgrade doesn't fix the exec thing
2015-08-23 18:23:37	Lokathor	Version 0.1.3.1, Git revision 42cf39bcfbe0e7a807b30e0536ec84aabf9957cb (1660 commits) X86_64
2015-08-23 18:23:50	Lokathor	see how i've got a later git version
2015-08-23 18:23:55	gfixler	yeah
2015-08-23 18:23:58	Lokathor	well... a "different" git version
2015-08-23 18:24:52	taksuyu	Hmm.. kinda surprised that it doesn't bump the version number and/or attach -dev to it when you build from source :0
2015-08-23 18:25:52	taksuyu	Maybe that's just my experience with C projects coming up though..
2015-08-23 18:25:59	gfixler	Lokathor: always wished git's hashes had the additional property of incrementing over time
2015-08-23 18:26:08	gfixler	but it makes no sense, because time is insane
2015-08-23 18:26:22	Lokathor	that's clearly not much of how a hash works :P
2015-08-23 18:26:41	taksuyu	Yep, it's meant to look completely different at a glance
2015-08-23 18:26:59	Lokathor	anyway, if you pull this repo https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack
2015-08-23 18:27:03	Lokathor	and use stack to build it
2015-08-23 18:27:12	Lokathor	then have stack install the new version over itself
2015-08-23 18:27:17	Lokathor	things might work slightly better
2015-08-23 18:27:33	Lokathor	the development is very rapid on stack. I put in a bug 2 days ago and they've already fixed it for me
2015-08-23 18:27:34	gfixler	that's like playing god
2015-08-23 18:27:39	gfixler	nice
2015-08-23 18:27:51	gfixler	sometimes rapid development scares me
2015-08-23 18:28:13	gfixler	I worry that the tool will keep changing out from under me, and that crazy ideas and feature bloat will leak in
2015-08-23 18:28:42	taksuyu	It's because they can rely on cabal being dependable that stack can do all sorts of fancy things
2015-08-23 18:28:52	taksuyu	Also welcome to being an early adopter :P
2015-08-23 18:28:58	gfixler	:)

2015-08-23 18:29:33	gfixler	we've solved the lens problem
2015-08-23 18:29:35	Lokathor	stack seems like it might have better long term luck with ffi stuff as well
2015-08-23 18:29:51	Lokathor	cabal + windows + ffi = sadness

2015-08-26 09:39:05	wkmanire	Did you have the opportunity to work with a publisher?
2015-08-26 09:39:11	bitemyapp	we did, we fired them.
2015-08-26 09:39:22	wkmanire	I'm just curious. I'm co-authoring a book with a friend of mine with Packt.
2015-08-26 09:39:26	codedmart	What I would like to be able to do is use Raw with Enter, but I either get func dep errors or others with what ever I try.
2015-08-26 09:39:29	wkmanire	oooh. Why did you fire them?
2015-08-26 09:39:37	codedmart	Anyone have some ideas/pointers for me?
2015-08-26 09:39:42	bitemyapp	wkmanire: we can talk privately if you want, but briefly, they would've ruined the book.
2015-08-26 09:39:58	bitemyapp	That combined with our desire to make it accessible to non-programmers and us wanting to get people to a place where they can write real stuff in Haskell or at least be positioned to learn whatever they need in order to do so.
2015-08-26 09:40:03	bitemyapp	so, that's why the book is long.
2015-08-26 09:40:08	wkmanire	bitemyapp: yes please. I would like to know what happened. We're both first time authors so any advice would be a huge help.
2015-08-26 09:40:17	bitemyapp	we don't take any real pleasure in editing a book this large, I assure you.
2015-08-26 09:40:22	codedmart	wkmanire or bitemyapp would love a peek at my gist if you have time.
2015-08-26 09:40:29	bitemyapp	wkmanire: we're both first time authors as well, although my coauthor had a master's thesis.

2015-08-26 10:40:27	wkmanire	Wow, literate haskell is awesome.
2015-08-26 10:40:38	wkmanire	I think this is the most well done literate "mode" I've seen in a programming language.
2015-08-26 10:41:08	kadoban	Really? It's kinda sparse … all it does is reverse the comments and code.
2015-08-26 10:41:23	wkmanire	Maybe it has something to do with Haskell not having an imperative, procedural ordering of statements of execution that it works so well.
2015-08-26 10:42:09	wkmanire	kadoban: My only point of reference really are giant block comments mixed with code.
2015-08-26 10:42:22	wkmanire	Or even worse, code inside of comments. Such as docstring tests in Python.

2015-08-26 10:43:04	kadoban	Heh, haskell has docstring as well XD
2015-08-26 10:43:16	kadoban	Although it's not really part of the language of course, just a library thing.
2015-08-26 10:43:49	wkmanire	Does GHCI understand literate haskell?
2015-08-26 10:44:20	kadoban	It can load modules from .lhs and such. I don't know if you can type in literate haskell into ghci … but then again I'm not sure why you'd want to either.
2015-08-26 10:44:35	wkmanire	I wouldn't. Being able to load them is sufficient.
2015-08-26 10:44:44	wkmanire	kadoban: http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures/02-ADTs.lhs
2015-08-26 10:44:53	wkmanire	It's nice that I can load these lessons into GHCI and play with the types and functions
2015-08-26 10:44:56	kadoban	Yep it supports that well. Most (all?) haskell tools do thankfully.

2015-08-26 10:48:42	wkmanire	Look  at Data Thing = Shoe....
2015-08-26 10:49:25	wkmanire	From python, I might do [t for t in Thing]
2015-08-26 10:50:00	kadoban	wkmanire: Yeah, you'd want to make it an instance of Enum and Bounded (both can be derived automatically). Then you can do [minBound .. maxBound] :: [Thing]
2015-08-26 10:50:16	wkmanire	Nice
2015-08-26 10:50:30	wkmanire	So, deriving Enum instead of deriving Show?
2015-08-26 10:50:49	kadoban	Usually in addition to, so:  deriving (Show, Enum, Bounded)

2015-08-31 07:16:57	frerich	anoe: I'd suggest to think about it inside-out: first, devise a function for turning a plain list of tuples into a list of User values. That would be 'map (\(x, y) -> User (x, y))' right? Now you want to fmap that function over your IO value. So you get  'fmap (map (\(x, y) -> User (x, y)))'
2015-08-31 07:18:17	frerich	anoe: A slightly nicer way to do that 'User' transformation is to just use 'User' by the way.
2015-08-31 07:18:28	frerich	anoe: I.e. "fmap (map User)'

2015-09-01 09:01:52	glguy	That 'b' is because it doesn't quite know what "0" you meant, but you have to provide a function that fits in that hole

2015-09-12 18:50:35	ReinH	bitemyapp: it's called A Computer Contradictionary and it's basically a Devil's Dictionary for CS
2015-09-12 18:51:00	ReinH	It was published in the late 90s and contains entries like: curry: v. transitive, see Schoenfinkel
2015-09-12 18:51:10	Big_G	What is it called when I want to do nothing if an Either is a left but operate as normal if it is right?
2015-09-12 18:51:43	ReinH	Big_G: well, that's how the functor, applicative, and monad instances behave
2015-09-12 18:51:52	ReinH	fsvo "do" and "nothing", I suppose.
2015-09-12 18:52:09	Big_G	ReinH, I know that but I thought there was a special word for it
2015-09-12 18:52:10	ReinH	> fmap succ (Left 1)
2015-09-12 18:52:12	lambdabot	 Left 1

2015-09-12 18:52:16	ReinH	Not really
2015-09-12 18:52:35	bitemyapp	ReinH: neat :)
2015-09-12 18:52:36	Big_G	ReinH, Shouldn't that be Left 2?
2015-09-12 18:52:39	ReinH	bitemyapp: found it at a used bookstore in Vancouver while I ws at ICFP!
2015-09-12 18:52:47	ReinH	Big_G: no, because fmap maps over Right and leaves Left alone
2015-09-12 18:52:50	bitemyapp	ReinH: since edward won't answer me, can you tell me what he's on about?
2015-09-12 18:52:58	Big_G	I misread that. I thought it said right
2015-09-12 18:53:12	ReinH	bitemyapp: He's figured out a new runtime he wants to try out with a new heap structure and GC, that's all I know so far.
2015-09-12 18:53:23	Big_G	Is thhere a rename of either with better names than left and right?
2015-09-12 18:53:29	bitemyapp	ReinH: and he's calling it Turbo Haskell?
2015-09-12 18:53:34	ReinH	left and right are the canonical names :)
2015-09-12 18:53:42	ReinH	bitemyapp: Apparently.
2015-09-12 18:53:48	ReinH	cf Turbo Pascal ;)
2015-09-12 18:53:51	kadoban	Big_G: Heh, just get used to those ones, they're very popular.
2015-09-12 18:53:55	Big_G	ReinH, I know they are but I find myself getting confused so I can only imagine how others feel
2015-09-12 18:54:00	bitemyapp	ReinH: yeah :)
2015-09-12 18:54:22	ReinH	Big_G: rust uses Ok and Err, which would make sense except that Either isn't only used for errors.
2015-09-12 18:54:33	kadoban	Big_G: If it helps you can think of Right as-in "correct"
2015-09-12 18:54:46	Big_G	ReinH, Yeah, I know. Really easy to confuse. 
2015-09-12 18:54:59	Big_G	kadoban, I already knew about that trick. Appreciate the help though
2015-09-12 18:55:00	ReinH	Either is just the canonical sum type and Left and Right are the canonical injections, in the same way that (a,b) is the canonical product type and fst and snd its canonical projections
2015-09-12 18:55:10	bitemyapp	ReinH: it's even stranger if you realize you may want to use either for things that will frequently fail _until_ they succeed.
2015-09-12 18:55:19	ReinH	Which is all well and good if you are a mathematician ;)
2015-09-12 18:55:20	bitemyapp	ReinH: then Left == err is terribly strange.
2015-09-12 18:55:37	ReinH	bitemyapp: which is why I don't like to use that interpretation
2015-09-12 18:55:42	bitemyapp	yeah.
2015-09-12 18:55:48	Big_G	What is the best way to have a sum type for errors? For example, I call two functions that have different error types and I want to combine them for the "meta" error type in that functions sig
2015-09-12 18:56:06	kadoban	Ah like you'd use it for "have I found the answer yet? nope, guess not." ?
2015-09-12 18:56:18	ReinH	the behavior of fmap et al is an artifact of the way Haskell treats multi-parameter higher kinded types and type classes, not some attempt to select Right as the success case.
2015-09-12 18:56:25	ReinH	It just happens to work out for that too
2015-09-12 18:56:41	ReinH	kadoban: Yes, see also EitherR :)
2015-09-12 18:56:55	kadoban	Heh, I'll check it out, sounds interesting.
2015-09-12 18:57:03	ReinH	It's in errors iirc?
2015-09-12 18:57:04	bitemyapp	kadoban: yep and I've used it for that before.
2015-09-12 18:57:05	ReinH	or either?
2015-09-12 18:57:12	ReinH	That namespace is pretty fubar
2015-09-12 18:57:17	kadoban	I can kinda imagine how that'd work, but still sounds interesting.
2015-09-12 18:57:33	Big_G	Is it apropiate to see Maybe as an alternate form of Either?
2015-09-12 18:58:22	ReinH	Big_G: you can see Either a b as Maybe b with the Nothing replaced with a tagged value.
2015-09-12 18:58:25	ReinH	If it helps.
2015-09-12 18:58:40	kadoban	Well, it's isomorphic to 'Either ()' I suppose
2015-09-12 18:58:48	Big_G	Is there any code shared there or are they entirely seperate?
2015-09-12 18:59:02	ReinH	entirely separate
